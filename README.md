# large-data-sortingAlgorithms

implemented algorithms:\
Heap sort\
Insertion sort\
Merge sort\
Quick sort

The Gen.java creates five arrays of size: 2^4, 2^6, 2^8, 2^10 and 2^12. The data represent product id,sales amount. eg:{b93ce429-5aa1-4a9f-8884-01f63e30e3fe,54}\
a1_in.txt is the generated file.

In this project I compared the sorting algorithms listed above.\
Result: basic quick sort was found to be the fastest.
