Basic Quick
mergeBU
Heap sort
Three partition Quick sort //this would be at first if there are many duplicates
mergeTD
binary insertions sort
basic insertion sort
insertions sort using comparable

I ordered the sorting algorithms from best to worst by considering their
performance and the numbers I got from the stop watch when sorting the arrays of size 2^4, 2^6, 2^8, 2^10, 2^12, 2^14 and 2^16.
